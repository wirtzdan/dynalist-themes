# Dynalist Themes

This is a collection of Dyanlist themes that I use. I didn't built them from scratch and instead adapted an already excisting theme to save me some time.

The Palenight theme is based on the [Dark Theme](https://talk.dynalist.io/t/my-custom-css-dark-theme/5202) by [Jay Kovski](https://github.com/jaykovski)
The Simple Light clean is based on the [Dynalist Clean Navigation Theme](https://userstyles.org/styles/144181/dynalist-clean-navigation) by [Samson Zhang](https://userstyles.org/users/446160)
